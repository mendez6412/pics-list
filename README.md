# Pics List
An exercise to work with React and images

## Running Locally
- Clone the repo
- Install node (if necessary) and the various packages (`npm i`)
- `yarn start`

## Notes
- First time w/ React + Typescript

## TODO
- Add unit tests
- See if hooks would be a good fit
    - Convert `List` class component to functional component + useEffect for `fetch()`
- Try other methods for uniformity in the images
